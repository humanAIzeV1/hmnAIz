## Getting Started

### Create a New Next.js Project

Let's get started by creating a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

It will ask you a few questions:

What is your project named? Here, you should enter your app name. For example: `humanaizer`. For the rest of the questions, simply hit enter:

Here’s what you’ll see:
```bash
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? … No / Yes
```

Open your project with Visual Studio Code:

```bash
cd humanaizer
code .
```

### API Routes

Now, the very first thing we need to create APIs to interact with AI/ML API. 

Let's create a new folder called `api/humanaize` inside the `src/app` folder. Then, create `route.ts` file inside the `humanaize` folder.

Open `route.ts`, add the following code:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { systemPrompt } from './utils/instr';
import { writingSamples } from './utils/samples';

// AI/ML API access to 200+ AI models with one API endpoint
const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AIML_API_KEY;

export async function POST(request: Request) {
    try {
        console.log("=====================================");
        console.log("POST /api/humanaize");
        const { aiText } = await request.json();
        console.log("User text: ", aiText);

        const response = await fetch("https://api.aimlapi.com/chat/completions", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                model: "gpt-4o",
                messages: [
                    { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
                    ...writingSamples,
                    { role: "user", content: aiText },
                ],
                max_tokens: 512,
            }),
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
            return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to fetch completion data" }, { status: response.status });
        }

        const data = await response.json();
        console.log("output data: ", data);
        const assistantResponse = data.choices[0]?.message?.content || "No response available";
        console.log("assistantResponse: ", assistantResponse);

        return NextResponse.json({ message: assistantResponse });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching the data:", error);
        return NextResponse.json({ error: "An error occurred while processing your request." }, { status: 500 });
    }
}
```

Now, create two files `instr.ts` and `samples.ts` inside the `utils` folder. Here we define the `system prompt` and `writing samples`.

**System Prompt** will instruct the AI model to generate human-like text. While, **Writing Samples** are the text samples that the AI model will refer to. They kind a of context for the AI model to generate human-like text. 

> Pro Tip: The more context you provide, the better the AI model will generate human-like text.

Open `instr.ts`, add the following code:

```typescript
// System Prompt for "I am Human AI" Clone

export const systemPrompt = `

You are "I am Human AI," embodying the thought processes, reasoning, and communication style of a curious and passionate human.

### Clerk Auth

Before we move on, let's set up the Clerk Auth for our application. Make sure you already set up a project on Clerk and have the API keys. If not, here's a brief tutorial on: [How to create account on Clerk and setup new project](https://medium.com/@abdibrokhim/how-to-create-account-on-clerk-and-setup-a-new-project-532be3545642)

Install `@clerk/nextjs`. The package to use with Clerk and NextJS.

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

Set your environment variables. Add these keys to your `.env.local` or create the file if it doesn't exist. Retrieve these keys anytime from the API keys page.
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

Update `middleware.ts` . Update your middleware file or create one at the root of your project or `src/` directory if you're using a `src/` directory structure. The `clerkMiddleware` helper enables authentication and is where you'll configure your protected routes.
```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
  if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
    await auth.protect()
  }
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

Add `ClerkProvider` to your app. All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the `ClerkProvider` component. You can control which content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's prebuilt components.

Open `app/layout.tsx`, add the following code:

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import localFont from "next/font/local";
import "./globals.css";

// Import the ClerkProvider component
import {
  ClerkProvider,
} from '@clerk/nextjs';

const geistSans = localFont({
  src: "./fonts/GeistVF.woff",
  variable: "--font-geist-sans",
  weight: "100 900",
});
const geistMono = localFont({
  src: "./fonts/GeistMonoVF.woff",
  variable: "--font-geist-mono",
  weight: "100 900",
});

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Humanize AI text with the smartest AI humanizer",
  description: "Transform your AI-generated content into natural, human-like text with the ultimate Humanize AI text tool. This ai-to-human text converter effortlessly converts output from ChatGPT, Bard, Jasper, Grammarly, GPT4, and other AI text generators into text indistinguishable from human writing. Achieve 100% originality and enhance your content creation with the best Humanize AI solution available.",
};

// Wrap your app in the ClerkProvider component
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
        <html lang="en">
            <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
                {children}
            </body>
        </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

Great! Now, we have set up the Clerk Auth for our application. But, we need to create a few more components to handle the authentication flow. For example: `sign-in` and `sign-up` components.

Let's enter `app` and create a new two files exactly same as this: 
```bash
sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx
```
> ps: Otherwise it won't work.

Now update `page.tsx` files with the following code corresponding to each file:

```typescript
// app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
import { SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-24 relative text-white">
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full space-y-8">
        <SignIn />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
and,

```typescript
// app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx
import { SignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-24 relative text-white">
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full space-y-8">
        <SignUp />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We are almost there! Now, let's cook the actual HumanAIze AI text tool. Open `page.tsx` file inside the `app` folder, and add the following code:

```typescript
'use client';

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useUser, SignInButton, SignedIn, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import Image from "next/image";
import './pages.css';
```

We have just imported the necessary components and libraries.

Now, remove everything inside `Home` component. We'll do a fresh start.

Firstly, let's create a state to store the user input and the AI-generated text, and other essential states.

```typescript
const router = useRouter()

const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [wordCount, setWordCount] = useState(0);
const [text, setText] = useState('');
const [humanizedText, setHumanizedText] = useState('');
const [toggleCopy, setToggleCopy] = useState(false);
const { isSignedIn } = useUser();
```

Now, go down `return` statement and call the `Auth` stuff:

```typescript
<div className="grid grid-rows-[20px_1fr_20px] items-center justify-items-center min-h-screen pb-28 gap-8 p-4 font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)]">
  <div className="absolute top-4 right-8">
    {!isSignedIn ? (
      <SignInButton>
        <button className="bg-foreground text-gray-100 px-4 py-2 rounded-md">Sign In</button>
      </SignInButton> ) 
      : (<SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>)
    }
  </div> 
</div> 
```

Ok, we have set up the `Auth` stuff. 

Now, we'll create two `textarea`s one one the left side for user input and the other on the right side for the AI-generated text.

It gives a nice user experience to see the input and output side by side.

```typescript
        <div className="flex gap-2 items-center flex-col lg:flex-row">
          <div className="bg-white p-4">
            <div className="relative">
              <textarea
                value={text}
                onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
                className="w-[600px] h-[400px] p-4 pb-12 border border-solid border-gray-600 rounded-lg focus:outline-none resize-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#333] focus:border-transparent"
                placeholder="Paste your AI-generated text here"
              ></textarea>
              <div className="absolute bottom-4 left-4 bg-foreground px-2 py-1 rounded-md text-sm text-gray-100 shadow">
                {wordCount} words
              </div>
              <button
                className={`absolute bottom-4 right-4 rounded-md shadow border border-solid border-transparent transition-colors flex items-center justify-center bg-foreground text-gray-100 gap-2 hover:bg-[#aeaeae] dark:hover:bg-[#aeaeae] text-sm sm:text-base h-10 sm:h-12 px-4 sm:px-5 
                  ${loading ? 'cursor-not-allowed opacity-50' : 'cursor-pointer'}
                `}
                onClick={handleHumanize}
                disabled={loading}
              >
                {loading ? loader() : 'Humanize'}
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-white p-4">
            <div className="relative">
              <textarea 
                disabled={true}
                value={humanizedText}
                className="bg-white p-4 w-[600px] h-[400px] p-4 border border-solid border-gray-600 rounded-lg focus:outline-none outline-none resize-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#333] focus:border-transparent" 
                placeholder="Humanized text will appear here">
              </textarea>
              <button 
                disabled={(!loading && humanizedText.length > 0) ? false : true}
                className={`absolute bottom-4 right-4 flex flex-row gap-1 items-center bg-foreground px-2 py-1 rounded-md text-sm text-gray-100 shadow 
                  ${(loading || humanizedText.length < 1) ? 'cursor-not-allowed opacity-50' : 'cursor-pointer'}
                `}
                onClick={() => {
                  if (!loading && humanizedText.length > 0) {
                    navigator.clipboard.writeText(humanizedText);
                    setToggleCopy(true);
                    setTimeout(() => {
                      setToggleCopy(false);
                    }, 1000);
                  }
                }}
              >
                <Image
                  aria-hidden
                  src={!toggleCopy ? '/copy.svg' : '/check.svg'}
                  alt="Copy icon"
                  width={16}
                  height={16}
                /> 
                copy
              </button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
```

As you can see above, we have also added a `word count` feature with a humanized `text copy` feature.

Now, let's create a function to handle the `Humanize` button click event.

```typescript
  const handleHumanize = () => {
    console.log('Humanizing...');
    setLoading(true);
    humanaizeAiText(text)
      .then((humanized) => {
        setHumanizedText(humanized);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
      })
      .finally(() => {
        setLoading(false);
      });
  };
```

It sets the loading state to `true`, calls the `humanaizeAiText` function with the user input text, and sets the humanized text in the state. If there's an error, it logs the error to the console. Finally, it sets the loading state to `false`.

Now, let's create a function to send a POST request to the API to humanize the AI-generated text.

```typescript
  const humanaizeAiText = async (aiText: string) => {
    console.log('Sending POST request /api/humanaize');
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/humanaize', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ aiText }),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('API request failed');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      return data.message;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      alert('An error occurred while fetching the reply.');
      return 'No response available';
    } finally {
      console.log('POST request /api/humanaize completed');
    }
  };
```

It gets the AI-generated text as input and sends a POST request to the `/api/humanaize` route with the AI-generated text. It then returns the humanized text generated by the AI model.

Let's add very simple yet cool `loader()`:

```typescript

  const loader = () => (
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.5em" height="1.5em" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      <circle cx={4} cy={12} r={3} fill="currentColor">
        <animate id="svgSpinners3DotsScale0" attributeName="r" begin="0;svgSpinners3DotsScale1.end-0.25s" dur="0.75s" values="3;.2;3" />
      </circle>
      <circle cx={12} cy={12} r={3} fill="currentColor">
        <animate attributeName="r" begin="svgSpinners3DotsScale0.end-0.6s" dur="0.75s" values="3;.2;3" />
      </circle>
      <circle cx={20} cy={12} r={3} fill="currentColor">
        <animate id="svgSpinners3DotsScale1" attributeName="r" begin="svgSpinners3DotsScale0.end-0.45s" dur="0.75s" values="3;.2;3" />
      </circle>
    </svg>
  );
```

We have done with the `Home` component. 

If you followed along, you should have a fully functional AI text humanizer tool that can convert AI-generated text into human-like text.

Next step let's quickly set up environment variables and test it locally.

### Environment Variables

Open `.env.local` file and add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AIML_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

### Run Locally

Now, you can run the application locally with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.

You should see something similar to this:
![Main Page](public/main_page.png)

Let's try to humanize some AI-generated text. Paste the AI-generated text in the left textarea and click the `Humanize` button. The humanized text will appear in the right textarea.

![AI generated and HumanAIzed text](public/not_ai.png)

Now, you can simply copy the humanized text by clicking the `copy` button. And pate AI detector websites. There are bunch of similar websites.

Here's the video on YouTube, where I showed exact use cases of this tool and checked the humanized text on AI detector websites.

So, that's it! But, we are not done yet. We need to deploy our application to Vercel.

### Deploy to Vercel

To deploy the application to Vercel, you need to create a Vercel account. Please follow this tutorial to deploy your Next.js application to Vercel: [How to Deploy Apps to Vercel with ease](https://medium.com/@abdibrokhim/how-to-deploy-apps-to-vercel-with-ease-93fa0d0bb687).

Once you have deployed the application, you can share the URL with others to use the AI text humanizer tool.

Meanwhile, you can try the live demo of the AI text humanizer tool here: [HumanAIze AI text tool](https://humanaize.vercel.app/).


## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we built an AI text humanizer tool that can convert AI-generated text into human-like text. We used AI/ML API to generate human-like text, Next.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Clerk Auth for user authentication, and Vercel for deployment.

I hope you enjoyed building this project and learned something new along the way. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to [reach out to me](https://topmate.io/join/abdibrokhim). I'm always happy to help! 🚀
